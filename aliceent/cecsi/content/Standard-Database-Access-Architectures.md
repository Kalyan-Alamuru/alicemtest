# Standard Database Access Architectures
In looking at the database access components described in the preceding section, it turns out that two of them — programming interfaces and data stream protocols — are good candidates for standardization. The other two components — IPC mechanism and network protocols — not only reside at too low a level but they are both highly dependent on the network and operating system. There is also a third approach — gateways — that provides possibilities for standardization.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Standard Programming Interface](../content/Standard-Programming-Interface.md)  
  
-   [Standard Data Stream Protocol](../content/Standard-Data-Stream-Protocol.md)  
  
-   [Standard Gateway](../content/Standard-Gateway.md)
