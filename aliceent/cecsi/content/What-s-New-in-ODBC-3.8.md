# What&#39;s New in ODBC 3.8
Windows 8 includes an updated version of ODBC 3.8. ODBC 3.8 in Windows 8 includes the following features:  
  
-   [Driver-Aware Connection Pooling](../content/Driver-Aware-Connection-Pooling.md)  
  
-   [Asynchronous Execution (Notification Method)](../content/Asynchronous-Execution--Notification-Method-.md)  
  
-   [Data Access Tracing (Windows 8)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh829624.aspx)  
  
-   PowerShell commands have been added to help you manage ODBC data sources, ODBC drivers, ODBC Performance Counter, and data access tracing at the command line.  For more information see [Windows Data Access Components PowerShell Commands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/jj134064.aspx).  
  
 Windows 7 includes an updated version of ODBC, ODBC 3.8. ODBC 3.8 includes the following features:  
  
-   Executing connection operations asynchronously. For more information, see [Asynchronous Execution (Polling Method)](../content/Asynchronous-Execution--Polling-Method-.md).  
  
-   Streamed output parameters. For more information, see [Retrieving Output Parameters Using SQLGetData](../content/Retrieving-Output-Parameters-Using-SQLGetData.md).  
  
-   ODBC C data type extensibility. For more information, see [C Data Types in ODBC](../content/C-Data-Types-in-ODBC.md).  
  
 Driver writers should read [Upgrading a 3.5 Driver to a 3.8 Driver](../content/Upgrading-a-3.5-Driver-to-a-3.8-Driver.md).  
  
 Asynchronous connection operations can be used by ODBC 3.x and ODBC 2.x applications with an ODBC 3.8 driver.  
  
 For more information, see [Compatibility Matrix](../content/Compatibility-Matrix.md).
