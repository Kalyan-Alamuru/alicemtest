# Microsoft-Supplied ODBC Drivers
*Drivers* are libraries that implement the functions in the ODBC API. Each driver is specific to a particular database management system (DBMS). In most cases, drivers expose the capabilities of the underlying DBMS; they are not required to implement capabilities not supported by the DBMS. Drivers perform specific tasks and can be classified into two categories: file-based and DBMS-based. For more information about drivers and driver architecture, see [Drivers](../content/Drivers.md).
