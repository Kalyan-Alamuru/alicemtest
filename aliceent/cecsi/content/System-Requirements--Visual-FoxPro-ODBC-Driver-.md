# System Requirements (Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver)
The system requirements for installation provide the minimum operating system and disk space needed to successfully install the driver. After you've installed the driver, you can select the specific application software you want to use to access Visual FoxPro data.  
  
## Installation Requirements  
 For installation requirements and other information, see [the Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver download site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=121318).  
  
## Accessing Visual FoxPro Data  
 To access Microsoft Visual FoxPro or FoxPro 2.*x* data, you must have the following:  
  
-   ODBC Client Software (automatically installed with the driver)  
  
-   Microsoft Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver  
  
-   Any of the following types of application software:  
  
    -   Microsoft Office application such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word  
  
    -   C or C++ language ODBC application  
  
    -   Microsoft Visual Basic ODBC application  
  
-   Any of the following types of data:  
  
    -   Visual FoxPro [database](../content/Visual-FoxPro-Terminology.md) or a directory of [free tables](../content/Visual-FoxPro-Terminology.md)  
  
    -   FoxPro 2.0, 2.5, 2.6 [table](../content/Visual-FoxPro-Terminology.md)
