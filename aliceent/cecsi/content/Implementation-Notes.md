# Implementation Notes
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This feature will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Microsoft recommends using the driver's cursor functionality.  
  
 This section describes how the ODBC cursor library is implemented. It describes how the cursor library maintains its cache, executes SQL statements, and implements ODBC functions.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Cursor Library Cache](../content/Cursor-Library-Cache.md)  
  
-   [Processing SQL Statements](../content/Processing-SQL-Statements.md)  
  
-   [ODBC Functions and the Cursor Library](../content/ODBC-Functions-and-the-Cursor-Library.md)
