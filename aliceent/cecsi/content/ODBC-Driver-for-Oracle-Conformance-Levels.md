# ODBC Driver for Oracle Conformance Levels
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This feature will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Instead, use the ODBC driver provided by Oracle.  
  
 ODBC defines two types of conformance standards for drivers: the API conformance standard and the SQL grammar conformance standard. API conformance refers to the functions that a driver supports. SQL conformance refers to the SQL grammar that the driver supports. Each conformance standard is made up of levels.  
  
 This section provides conformance information about the ODBC Driver for Oracle.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [API Conformance Level (ODCB Driver for Oracle)](../content/API-Conformance-Level--ODBC-Driver-for-Oracle-.md)  
  
-   [Supported Options (ODCB Driver for Oracle)](../content/Supported-Options--ODBC-Driver-for-Oracle-.md)
