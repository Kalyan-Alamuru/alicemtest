# Application and Driver Compatibility
ODBC applications and driver fall into a number of categories in addition to their version. Some of these applications are incompatible with some drivers; in other cases, the type of the application or driver may have a bearing on the backward compatibility issues between them.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Types of Applications](../content/Types-of-Applications.md)  
  
-   [Types of Drivers](../content/Types-of-Drivers.md)
