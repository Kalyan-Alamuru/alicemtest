# Constructing SQL Statements
SQL statements can be constructed in one of three ways: hard-coded during development, constructed at run time, or entered directly by the user.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Hard-Coded SQL Statements](../content/Hard-Coded-SQL-Statements.md)  
  
-   [SQL Statements Constructed at Run Time](../content/SQL-Statements-Constructed-at-Run-Time.md)  
  
-   [SQL Statements Entered by the User](../content/SQL-Statements-Entered-by-the-User.md)
