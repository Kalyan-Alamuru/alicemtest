# Visual Studio Analyzer
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Support for Visual Studio Analyzer was removed beginning in Windows 8 (Visual Studio Analyzer was only included in older versions of Visual Studio.). For an alternative troubleshooting mechanism, use BID tracing.  
  
 Microsoft® Visual Studio™ Analyzer provides a high-level view of the ODBC application. The developer can evaluate, analyze, and debug the structure, performance, and interactions from the application's perspective, rather than from a component or code perspective. The information gathered by Visual Studio Analyzer is in the form of events, which represent some kind of interaction between two components of the application. Events can be composed of function calls and returns from functions, such as connections, database queries, and transactions.
