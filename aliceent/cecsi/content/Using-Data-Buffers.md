# Using Data Buffers
Data buffers are described by three pieces of information: their type, address, and byte length. Whenever a function needs one of these pieces of information and does not already know it, it has an argument with which the application passes it.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Data Buffer Type](../content/Data-Buffer-Type.md)  
  
-   [Data Buffer Address](../content/Data-Buffer-Address.md)  
  
-   [Data Buffer Length](../content/Data-Buffer-Length.md)
