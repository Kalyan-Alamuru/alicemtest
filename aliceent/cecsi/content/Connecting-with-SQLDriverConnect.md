# Connecting with SQLDriverConnect
**SQLDriverConnect** is used to connect to a data source using a connection string. **SQLDriverConnect** is used instead of **SQLConnect** for the following reasons:  
  
-   To let the application use driver-specific connection information.  
  
-   To request that the driver prompt the user for connection information.  
  
-   To connect without specifying a data source.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.
