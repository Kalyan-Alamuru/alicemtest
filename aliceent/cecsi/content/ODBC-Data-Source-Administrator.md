# ODBC Data Source Administrator
The MicrosoftÂ® ODBC Data Source Administrator manages database drivers and data sources. This application is located in the Windows Control Panel under **Administrative Tools**. Beginning in Windows 8, the icon is named **ODBC Data Sources**, and on 64-bit operating systems there is a 32-bit and 64-bit version.  
  
 For information about detailed ODBC Administrator procedures, open the [ODBC Data Source Administrator](assetId:///eea94d94-f53b-4289-ae75-9ccccde15333) dialog box and click **Help**.  
  
 You can use PowerShell commands to manage drivers and data sources. For more information about these PowerShell commands, see [Windows Data Access Components PowerShell commands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/jj134064.aspx).
