# ODBC Component Files
The ODBC Driver files are required by each component of ODBC Desktop Database Drivers 4.0.  
  
 Some files are required by more than one component. These files must be redistributed if you intend to redistribute any of the ODBC Desktop Database Drivers with your commercial applications.  
  
 These files are installed in the \Windows\System directory for Windows 95 or later, or in the \Windows\System32 directory for Windows NT 3.51 or later and Windows 2000. If ODBC files were previously installed in a different directory, make sure that you use the newer files in the \Windows\System (or System32) directory.
